# Single Page Data Science Projects

This page details some short data science projects that fit in one Jupyter Notebook covering exploratory data analysis and short machine learning projects. 

Some are adapted or expanded from courses that I have taken, some are small pieces of work I have done during my own work or for others and some are just for fun!

1 [Original Six Ice Hockey](./OriginalSix.ipynb)  
2 [UK Traffic Accidents](./UK_Accidents_Classifier.ipynb)   
3 [Ceramic Kiln Sensor Data ](./Kiln_Insulation.ipynb)

## [Original Six Ice Hockey](./OriginalSix.ipynb)
- Data extraction from Wikipedia using Pandas
- Data cleaning and wrangling and combining non-uniform datasets.
- Clean visualisation
- Time series prediction

This project is an extension of the [Applied Data Science with Python Specialisation](../../../Applied-Data-Science-with-Python) Course 2 final project with some added time series analysis and prediction for the next seasons final points. 

## [UK Traffic Accidents](./UK_Accidents_Classifier.ipynb)
- Data cleaning a larger dataset
- Machine learning and evaluation using gradient boosting and random forests. 

This project looks at UK traffic accident data between 2005 and 2017 and attempts to predict the type of accident (fatal, serious or slight) given the variables leading up to the accident.

## [Ceramic Kiln Sensor Data ](./Kiln_Insulation.ipynb)
- Time series analysis
- Industrial project

This project developed from some explanatory data analysis on temperature sensor data used in the kilns used to manufacture ceramic cores for industrial gas turbine and jet engine turbine blades. The aim was to see if there was a way to identify when the insulation had worn and was becoming less effective with the ultimate aim of saving energy by replacing worn insulation.

The data was provided in the form of time series data with multiple temperature ramp, hold and cooling stages over a 5 day run.
